# url-shortener-csharp

Sample URL Shortener written in C#.

This is a toy project to simply go from 0 and some spec to AWS prod using C# ecosystem.

This is not the code i write in prod, please don't PR me with cleaner version ðŸ¤£. A LOT of corners where cut. The bits that i felt especially bad about are commented accordingly, but some aren't, so if you have a sensitive nose, you were warned.

## Installation

Never tried from scratch myself, but i imagine

# it now runs, head to example.http file and make some calls
```
